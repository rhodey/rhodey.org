Some MIDI
Early in the Summer of 2014 I was lucky enough to drive a junky old bus days up North and spend a full week with friends and community at [ToorCamp](http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/). I wish I had done more to document the ways in which we [broke](https://twitter.com/liliakai/status/489122375506489346) and fixed this bus and how the bus broke and fixed us in return but all I have to tell you now is that at some point in that trip my laptop screen cracked, badly. My broken laptop led to weeks of unproductivity but concluded in my first MIDI composition.

Early in the Summer of 2014 I was lucky enough to drive a junky old bus days up North and spend a full week with friends and community at [ToorCamp](http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/). I wish I had done more to document the ways in which we [broke](https://twitter.com/liliakai/status/489122375506489346) and fixed this bus and how the bus broke and fixed us in return but all I have to tell you now is that at some point in that trip my laptop screen cracked, badly. The screen had cracked so badly that it was no longer possible to open and close, effectively transformed into a desktop. I used this as an excuse to dive into a spell of solitary and spent the next couple months working from home-- not an awful idea, but definitely not awesome.

Eventually my productivity started to fade and then vanished altogether. About a week later I gave up on trying to work ([fixing Flock bugs, if you cared to know](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Flock/issues)) , sourced a cheap local MIDI keyboard, and spent the day in my blacked-out room awash in red light messing around with MIDI. I didn't have any plans going into this but after a couple hours hit on a melody that was in-line with my mood and kept with it.

At night I find myself in this mood pretty often but still much less frequent than the many nights I spent in Vermont. When I hit this mood with snow on the ground in VT I would brew a coffee, grab some tobacco, and meditate outside wearing a tshirt and PJ pants. It is much easier to reach calm once your limbs go numb but I also really enjoyed the head rush upon reentering the house. When I hit this mood and my corner of VT was clear of snow I'd grab a drink and walk through miles of forests and fields under the moon. It is the latter of these two habits that I associate more with this audio clip.
